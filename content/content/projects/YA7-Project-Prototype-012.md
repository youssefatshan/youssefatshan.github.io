Cyber Moon is a modern prototype for a fictional tech startup specializing in web and mobile app development, cloud services, and AI integration. Designed and coded as a portfolio piece, this project highlights my skills in responsive UI development, component-based architecture, and brand-driven web design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Next.js (React)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Animations:** AOS (Animate On Scroll) Library
* **Themes:** next-themes for Dark/Light Mode
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üåó Dark/Light Mode:** A smooth, theme-aware toggle that persists across sessions using `next-themes`.
* **üß± Modular Design:** Built with reusable React components for key sections like navigation, services, testimonials, and blog previews.
* **üñºÔ∏è Animated UI:** Implemented elegant scroll-based fade and slide effects with the AOS library to enhance user engagement.
* **üì± Fully Responsive:** Features a mobile-first design with a drawer navigation menu, ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
* **üé® Custom Branding:** The design uses the Rajdhani font and a custom color palette inspired by celestial aesthetics to create a strong, tech-forward brand identity.
* **üöÄ Optimized Performance:** The site is optimized for fast load times and deployed on Vercel, a platform known for its performance with Next.js applications.

## üí°Purpose & Design Philosophy

As a portfolio piece, Cyber Moon's primary goal is to demonstrate both technical and design capabilities in a realistic setting. The design direction was inspired by celestial themes, using deep blues, soft grays, and golden accents to create a layout that is clean, modern, and built to impress potential clients or employers. It serves as a high-fidelity showcase of what I can deliver.
