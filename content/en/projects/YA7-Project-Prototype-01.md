# Brushstrokes: Skin-Care E-Commerce Prototype
### A clean, elegant, and responsive storefront for a premium skin-care brand.

---

### Overview: The Challenge

For a premium skincare brand, an online store must be more than just functional‚Äîit needs to convey elegance, quality, and a seamless user experience. The challenge was to design and develop a complete e-commerce prototype from scratch that was not only visually appealing but also structured with a clean, maintainable codebase using React.js.

## üéØ Key Features & Tech Stack

As the sole developer and designer, I built this prototype with a focus on a clean user interface and a modern, lightweight tech stack.

* **JSON-Powered Catalog:** Product information (names, prices, images) is dynamically loaded from a local **JSON file**, demonstrating a flexible approach to static data management in a React application.
* **Component-Based UI:** The entire interface, from the product grid to the navigation, was built with reusable **React components** for a clean and scalable architecture.
* **Dynamic Animations:** Subtle animations and transitions were implemented with **CSS** to enhance user engagement and provide a polished, modern feel.
* **Custom UI/UX Design:** The visual identity, layout, and user flow were designed and developed from the ground up to create a unique and compelling brand experience.

To bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping, an interactive "Virtual Try-On" feature was designed. This allows users to see how products might look, increasing engagement and purchase confidence.

The product listing uses a clean, spacious grid layout. Each product card clearly displays the item, name, and price, with a simple hover effect that encourages user interaction and exploration.

A dedicated testimonials section builds social proof and customer trust. The clean, quote-focused design makes the feedback easy to read and adds a layer of authenticity to the brand.

## üé® Design & UI/UX Process

The design goal was to create a functional and visually appealing prototype that reflects the quality of a premium skincare brand.

* **Audience:** Customers interested in high-quality, nourishing skincare products.
* **Color Palette:** A soft and natural palette to evoke a sense of calm and quality.
* **Typography:** An elegant serif for headings and a clean sans-serif for body text were chosen for their classic and readable qualities.
