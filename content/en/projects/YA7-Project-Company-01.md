## üéØ Key Features & Tech Stack

As the frontend developer, I focused on building a feature-rich and reliable user experience using a modern tech stack.

* **Dynamic Navigation:** A sticky navbar that transitions from transparent to solid on scroll, built with `react-scroll` for smooth, animated navigation to different sections.
* **Interactive UI:** Implemented engaging hover effects, a sleek testimonial slider, and animated text with `React Typing Effect` to create a dynamic user experience.
* **Reliable Contact Form:** Integrated the **Web3Forms API** to ensure that customer inquiries from the contact form are delivered instantly and reliably via email.
* **Performance-First:** Utilized **Vite** for a rapid development workflow and an optimized, fast-loading production build.
