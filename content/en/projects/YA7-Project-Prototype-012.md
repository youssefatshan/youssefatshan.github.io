## üéØ Key Features & Tech Stack

As the sole developer and designer, I built this prototype using a modern, performance-oriented tech stack to bring the celestial-themed brand to life.

* **Dark/Light Mode:** A smooth, theme-aware toggle using `next-themes` that persists the user's choice, providing a comfortable viewing experience in any lighting condition.
* **Modular Architecture:** Built with reusable **React components** for every section, ensuring the codebase is clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.
* **Animated UI:** Implemented elegant scroll-based fade and slide effects with the **AOS library** to enhance user engagement and guide them through the content.
* **Performance Optimized:** Leveraged **Next.js** for server-side rendering and fast page loads, deployed globally via **Vercel**.
